For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many noble, not many wise men after the flesh were called. For God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and weak things of the world to confound things which are mighty. And base things of the world, and things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.
